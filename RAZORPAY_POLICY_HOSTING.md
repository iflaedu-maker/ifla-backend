# Host Policies on Razorpay (Recommended for Payments)

Razorpay provides a wizard to create and host mandatory policies. You can point your checkout to those hosted URLs.

## Steps

1. Log in to Razorpay Dashboard
2. Go to Settings → Policies (or Business Profile)
3. Use the Policy Wizard to create:
   - Terms & Conditions
   - Privacy Policy
   - Refund & Cancellation Policy (include refund timelines)
   - Shipping & Delivery Policy (include min/max timelines)
   - Contact Us (with Indian phone, email, and operational address)
4. Save and publish
5. Copy the hosted policy URLs
6. Add those URLs to:
   - Razorpay checkout options
   - Your website footer/links (optional)

## Using Hosted URLs in Checkout
If you render Razorpay Checkout via JS, include policy links in your UI, or embed them into your site footer.

> Note: Razorpay Checkout itself doesn’t render policy links, but many aggregators require you to show them near the payment button. Link to the Razorpay-hosted policy pages.

## Keep Both
- Keep the on-site pages (e.g., /terms, /privacy, /refunds, /shipping, /contact-us) for SEO and user trust.
- Also host policies on Razorpay for compliance and easy verification.
